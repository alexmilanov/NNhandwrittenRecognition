# NNhandwrittenRecognition
This project is example of Feedfroward neural network develop with help of Matlab's functions. Best accuracy achieved was about 95%.
If neurons in hidden layer are more, may be accuracy will be over 96% but time for calculations will be more than 10 hours (may be different in less or more powerful machines). 

NNhandwrittenRecognitionUnreg.m is version without regularization and NNhandwrittenRecognition.m is file with regularization.

Usage: just open in MATLAB NNhandwrittenRecognition.m and run it. These files are tested with MATLAB R2006a.
